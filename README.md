This is a single player action game based on [Injustice1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us_(comics)) and [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice_2_(comics)). <br/>A player gets to beat Superman back into his red sun prison for the atrocities he commited.<br/>I used **vuejs** for event-handling and DOM manipulation<br/>You should read the comics if you haven't. It's one messed up story-line.
